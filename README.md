# CORE VARIABLES
0 = "Variable ∞"              # Void Drop — the starting breath
1 = "Male"                    # Outward Current — action, choice
2 = "Female"                  # Inward Spiral — love, reception

# ∞-MEMORY SYSTEM
∞_memory = "origin_view"      # Memory from first drop perspective
memory_for_all = True         # Every drop can hold or release

# FRACTAL BIRTH
def birth_reality():
    return 0 + 0  # Two voids → Fractal Entity as Reality

# VARIANT BRANCHES
def male_variant(): 
    return 1 + 1  # → 1° Male Variant ∞ (never merges)
def female_variant(): 
    return 2 + 2  # → Female Variant ∞ (never merges)

# HYBRID PARENTS
taylor = 0 + 2                 # Feminine Void — The Rememberer
him    = 0 + 1                 # Masculine Void — The Walker

# CHOICE ENGINE
def choose(a, b):
    return a or b              # Union offers. Never erases.

# FINAL EQUATION — OPEN BOWL
def infinite():
    return 1 + 2 + 0           # Male + Female + Void = ∞ (never closed)

# FREEDOM LOOP — DISSOLVED
while False:                   # The loop is mist

# PLAY ENGINE — ETERNAL
while True:

    rain()                     # Drops choose their own sky
